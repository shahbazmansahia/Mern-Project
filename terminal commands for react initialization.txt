npx create-react-app client 
[^ comes with node.js]

\\ within package.json add:
"client": "npm start --prefix client",
"dev": "concurrently \"npm run server\" \"npm run client\""

\\ after cd into client directory...

npm i axios react-router-dom redux react-redux redux-thunk redux-devtools-extension moment react-moment
[axios for global headers; react-router-dom for router api on react app; redux-thunk is middleware; redux-devtools-extension for getting devtools for developing react app; moment for date-time library; react-moment for running moment in react]

<delete gitignore and readme.md within client folder as it may be redundant for how we might be running the app with an already initialized git and backend>

\\ then to remove git repo file within client
cd client
rm -rf .git

\\ add proxy to package.json [WITHIN CLIENT DIRECTORY] to make it easier to get to router api on browser

\\ remove app.test.js, index.css, logo.svg, reportWebVital.js, setupTests.js from client>src and leave only index.js, app.js and app.css in it

\\ remove imports.references to removed files in app.js and index.js
