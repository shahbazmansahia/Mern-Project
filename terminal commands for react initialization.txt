\\ SHORTCUTS TO REMEMBER FOR REACT:
racf \\ generates component file
racfp \\ generates props component file

npx create-react-app client 
[^ comes with node.js]

\\ within package.json add:
"client": "npm start --prefix client",
"dev": "concurrently \"npm run server\" \"npm run client\""

\\ after cd into client directory...

npm i axios react-router-dom redux react-redux redux-thunk redux-devtools-extension moment react-moment
[axios for global headers; react-router-dom for router api on react app; redux-thunk is middleware; redux-devtools-extension for getting devtools for developing react app; moment for date-time library; react-moment for running moment in react]

<delete gitignore and readme.md within client folder as it may be redundant for how we might be running the app with an already initialized git and backend>

\\ then to remove git repo file within client
cd client
rm -rf .git

\\ add proxy to package.json [WITHIN CLIENT DIRECTORY] to make it easier to get to router api on browser

\\ remove app.test.js, index.css, logo.svg, reportWebVital.js, setupTests.js from client>src and leave only index.js, app.js and app.css in it

\\ remove imports.references to removed files in app.js and index.js

\\ after configuring client>package.json; from root [i.e. outside client]
npm run dev


\\ Install uuid for easy random number generation
npm i uuid

\\ NOTE: for uuid, the syntax for importing has now changed to (in ES6):
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid'; \\ for importing uuid.v4, in this statement

\\ NOTE: order of alert file calls "components\auth\Register.js" --- goes to --> "actions\alert.js" --- goes to --> "reducers\alert.js" --- goes to --> "components\layout\Alert.js"

\\ NOTE: 'redirect' IN 'react-router-dom' HAS BEEN REPLACED BY 'Navigate'

\\ NOTE: 'withRouter' and 'history'/'history.push()' have been replaced with 'useNavigate' and 'navigate' respectively as a part of react router v6.

\\ ------- THE FOLLOWING IS DUE TO REACT ROUTER V5 --> V6 ADAPTION 
\\ NOTE: outer <Fragment> has been changed to/now uses <section className=xx> value
\\ NOTE: UseEffect() is now used to check for data gets and other checks (history??), useNavigate is used for navigation (redirection)
\\ NOTE: 'e => onChange (e)' is now simply replaced with 'onChange'; not even the method/function, just onChange. Same goes for (similarly declared) onSubmit

\\ NOTE: Whenever dealing with forms, we will always import useState from 'react'
\\ WORKFLOW for new redux components: Define new Reducer --> define new Action(s) --> Define new component(s)
